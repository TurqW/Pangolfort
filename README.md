# Pangolfort
 This mod replaces the default "pangolin people" with Pangols, a custom race with playable civs.

## New Features

### Pangols

Pangols are a race of free-spirited pangolin people with metallic coppery scales. Larger than dwarves and shorter but broader than humans, their metal scales and claws give them a bit of an edge in combat, though they prefer to avoid it when possible. They hail from forested swamplands, and are natural swimmers and climbers. They tend to build tightly-clustered jumbles of wooden buildings around trees and/or on timbers sunk into the swamp mud, which they defend with bows and polehammers. They are perseverant, friendly, peaceful, and joyful, but donâ€™t much stand for decorum, pride, or ambition.

 - Their scales provide some protection, modesty & warmth and make many types of clothing difficult to wear, so they have a reduced list of clothing and armor options.
 - They have their own language for naming things, distinct from the existing ones.

Though they can brew and drink all the standard alcohols, they gain much more benefit from:

### Orebrew

Process ores at a mill or a quern to produce Orebrew, a metallic slurry that gives Pangols the nutrients they need for their metallic scales to heal. In lower metal-frequency worlds, this is sure to keep you digging.

### Poisons

Combine lye with other materials to brew poisons with various effects at the new Alchemist laboratory. Apply them to ammo in the same place.

## Use this mod if you:

 - Like pangolins as much as I do
 - Want a slightly easier experience without just disabling features
    - They definitely hold up a bit better than dwarves in combat (metal scales will do that)
    - They're just a bit slower to get grumpy
    - Their nobles are less demanding
 - Want a slightly harder experience - play as dwarves, pick a fight with your Pangol neighbors!
 - Just want to try something slightly different
